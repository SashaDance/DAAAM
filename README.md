Real-time foundation-model-first robot mapping: SAM segmentation + BotSort tracking + VLM grounding feed into [Hydra](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra) to build 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs on the fly.

Key contributions:
- Novel optimization-based frontend for semantic descriptions from localized captioning models
- Hierarchical 4D scene graph construction with real-time performance
- State-of-the-art results on NaVQA and SG3D benchmarks
